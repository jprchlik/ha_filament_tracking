#A program/script suite which analyzes Halpha filaments from the HEK


The directory structure is as follows:


#gong 
is the local copy of H alpha data from the GONG network.

#init_data
contains the track data given to SAO by GSU.

#nice_tracks
is a directory focused on plotting the best tracks in the current data set.

#obs_long_plot
is a directory containing scripts which plot the H alpha tracks on H alpha data spanning the data set.

#plot_tracks
is a directory which only contains an early version of the plotting routine. It is no longer useful.
